<p>Rudy Maxa: Like that _intrepid__ group of American tourists, most of us choose to travel because we want to. We’ve come a long way from times when we had to __wander____ through different lands without homes living as __nomads_. Or have we? Even today when we can easily interact with someone by picking up a phone or logging onto a computer, some people still make their living constantly traveling from place to place. Their only addresses exist as ___email__ or _cellphone numbers___. Welcome to the world of the ___high-tech nomads____. Writer Joel Garreau investigated this unique breed of traveler for The Washington Post, and he sat down with us recently to tell us what he learned.
